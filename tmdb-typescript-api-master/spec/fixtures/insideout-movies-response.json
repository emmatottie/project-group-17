Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley's mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",

The finish line is only a starting point for a new adventure. What happens in between is where the real action is. Our mission is to document the future of mountain biking as it unfolds in real time. We capture the true lifestyle that intersects our lives as professional mountain bikers, builders and filmmakers, concocting a unique chemistry of filmic goodness. Many past films, riders, and locations have inspired us. Some of those locations are now our backyards, and some of those riders are now our friends. From the Inside Out is our adventure to the places we've always wanted to ride, and our expression of the lines and styles that have influenced us. This is freeride mountain biking. This film is from us â€“ the riders.",
